            <li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Make cookies: Beat sugar, butter, shortening, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Gradually mix dry ingredients mixture into the wet ingredients just until combined. Shape dough into walnut-sized balls.</li>
            <li>Make cinnamon-sugar: Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl or zip-top plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Place dough balls in cinnamon-sugar and roll or shake until coated. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until set but not too hard, 8 to 10 minutes, switching racks halfway through.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and immediately transfer to wire racks to cool.</li>
        </ol>
